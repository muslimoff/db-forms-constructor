<p class="bodytext">The Player deployment format that is published from the Developer is not only useful in various training and educational initiatives; it is also designed to provide in-application support for end users. </p>
<p class="bodytext">There are specific add-ons and instructions for certain major enterprise applications to accommodate context-sensitive in-application support; these applications are referred to as target applications throughout this document. Content for target applications can generally be deployed using one or both of the following methods, depending on the target application:</p>
<ul class="listbulletindent"><li class="listbulletindent">Help Integration - This method allows users to invoke context-sensitive in-application support content using the existing target application Help menu or Help link.</li><li class="listbulletindent">SmartHelp - This is a toolbar button for browsers that end users may use to access context-sensitive in-application support content. </li></ul><p class="bodytext">The mechanism for context-sensitivity used for target applications is known as ExactMatch. This technique allows the Player to display a list of content that is related to the end user's activity in the application. The relevancy of the content list is determined based on content items that contain exactly the same context information as recorded during content creation in the Developer.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The mechanism for context-sensitivity for browser-based non-target applications is known as SmartMatch. This technique uses statistical analysis to rank the most probable content items and generates a list of relevant content. This allows you to use the SmartHelp toolbar button to deploy context-sensitive in-application support for any browser-based application.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Finally, content created for non-target applications prior to the introduction of SmartMatch technology may still be deployed using the SmartHelp toolbar button for the browser without context-sensitivity. In this case, the outline displays all of the content items; however, the user may find the appropriate items using the Search feature or by browsing the content outline. </p>
