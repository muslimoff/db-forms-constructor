<h2 class="heading2">Use SmartHelp for Browser-based Applications</h2>
<p class="bodytext">For browser-based applications, the SmartHelp toolbar button can be used to deploy in-application performance support. SmartHelp can be used for context-sensitive ExactMatch or SmartMatch content for various target and non-target applications. </p>
<p class="bodytext">The traditional Help Integration approach is recommended for deploying context-sensitive in-application performance support content for a single target application as it does not require the SmartHelp toolbar button to be distributed to end-user desktops. However, if content is being deployed for multiple browser-based target applications or for non-target applications, then SmartHelp may be a consistent way to deliver help for all browser-based applications. </p>
<p class="bodytext">SmartHelp is a toolbar button for Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers. Browser-based applications that suppress the browser's toolbar may not take advantage of the SmartHelp features. SmartMatch functionality for non-target applications (statistically relevant content items ranked in order to generate the list of applicable content items) is only available with the SmartHelp toolbar button.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It is possible to configure the same SmartHelp toolbar button to deploy multiple browser-based target applications as well as non-targeted applications. The end users will benefit from ExactMatch behavior when using the SmartHelp toolbar button for target applications and SmartMatch behavior when using the SmartHelp toolbar button for non-targeted browser-based applications.</p>
<p class="subheading">SmartHelp Installation Requirements for Internet Explorer</p>
<p class="subparagraph">The user who installs, configures, and uninstalls SmartHelp must have administrator rights to the local computer. Medium or medium-low security is recommended for the published content. In the Security tab, Local Intranet and Trusted Sites have the recommended security levels. For SmartHelp to work properly, the following settings should be as follows:</p>
<ul class="listbulletindent"><li class="listbulletindent">Download signed ActiveX controls: Enable or Prompt</li><li class="listbulletindent">Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins: Enable</li><li class="listbulletindent">Script ActiveX controls marked safe for scripting: Enable</li></ul><p class="noteparagraph"><strong class="bold">Note:</strong> If Internet Explorer and the operating system have Protected Mode support, the content locations and applications used with SmartHelp must have the same Internet Explorer mode, either Protected or Unprotected.</p>
